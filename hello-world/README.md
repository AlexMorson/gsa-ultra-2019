# 1 Across: "Hello, world"

Welcome to GSA ULTRA. Consider this the easy problem to see how it all works! For this problem we would like you to write a function that takes two integer inputs, ![\inline a](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%20a) and ![\inline b](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%20b), and adds them together. Please do not change the function signature or your answer will not be accepted!

The entry into the crossword will be the sum of ![\inline 5432](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%205432) and ![\inline 3333](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%203333) and will be inserted into the crossword automatically.
