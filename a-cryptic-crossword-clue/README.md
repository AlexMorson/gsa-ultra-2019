# 4 Down: "A cryptic crossword clue"

![\inline \textrm{Recomputing ``let" expression, allowing universal computation (6, 8)}](http://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cinline%20%5Ctextrm%7BRecomputing%20%60%60let%22%20expression%2C%20allowing%20universal%20computation%20%286%2C%208%29%7D)

Output the sum of the ASCII values of the 14 letters of the answer to the above clue, using only lower case characters and excluding any whitespace characters.

Note that there is no input for this question.

## My Solution

My first instinct was "Turing Machine", but that has the wrong number of letters. I'm not super sure about the first half of the clue, but the words "let expression" reminded me of Haskell, which then reminded me of Lambda Calculus.

### Actual Solution

This is the one problem that I got the wrong answer for in the crossword puzzle. The correct answer and an explanation have been kindly provided to me by one of the organisers of the competition:

**Solution:** Turing complete<br>
**Explanation:** The word "expression" here serves as an anagram indicator, applying to the letters of "Recomputing "let"". "allowing universal computation" grammatically suggests an adjective, so "Turing complete" is a better fit than the noun "lambda calculus", notwithstanding that indeed lambda calculus is Turing complete and by tricky coincidence has the same numbers of letters.
