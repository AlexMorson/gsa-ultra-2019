# 11 Down: "One-ing streak"

You're given an array $A$ of $N$ elements $A_1, A_2, ..., A_N$, where $A_i$ is either $0$ or $1$, for $1 \leq i \leq N$. A subarray of array $A$ is defined as a non-empty sequence of contiguous elements from array $A$.

Your objective is to find the longest subarray in which every element is a $1$. Output the index of the first element in the subarray. If there are multiple such subarrays, select the one which has smallest such index. If no such subarray exists, output $-1$.

### Input

- $A$: a tuple of $N$ integers $A_1, A_2, .., A_N$.

### Constraints

- $1 \leq N \leq 10^7$
