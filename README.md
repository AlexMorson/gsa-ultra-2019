# GSA ULTRA 2019

This repository contains my solutions for GSA ULTRA 2019. The questions each have their own folder with a README containing the problem statement, the code I wrote for it and a short writeup of how I approached the problem.

I answered all of the problems except for "It's a cover up" and "The good, the bad and the stringy" and submitted my solutions with 4 minutes to spare!

## Results

I came in 20th place!! My code passed 60.68% of the test cases, and I got 11 of the 14 answers on the crossword correct.

~~That means that I got one of "Cool, cool, cool" or "A cryptic crossword clue" wrong (I had different numbers in the square they cross at).~~<br>
**Update:** The answer that I got wrong on the crossword was "A cryptic crossword clue".
